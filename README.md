# Fiting-multiple-linear-regression-model-for-the-analysis-of-chemical-compounds-causes-air-pollution
Air Pollution is currently one of the most serious public health worries worldwide. Many
epidemiological studies have proved that some chemical compounds such as sulphur
dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3) or other air-borne dust particles can
have on our health. missMDA library in R contains ozone dataset containing 112
observations recorded during summer 2001 in Rennes (France).<br>

## Objectives:
- Generate the list of variables included in the data using R.<br>
- Create the subset of the data containing only the first 11 variables.<br>
- Fit a multiple linear regression model for maxO3 as a response variable and all the
remaining 10 variables as regressor variables. Use summary option to identify which of
these variables appear to be significant.
